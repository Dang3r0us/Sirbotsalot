## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you see a vulnerability please report it by [opening an issue](https://github.com/dangerous-games/Sirbotsalot/issues) and labeling it with the label "secuity issue".
 If the issue is an immediate problem contact an admin. 

*Disclaimer: just because a version is not supported with security updates **does not** mean that it is insecure just that it has not been tested for vulnerabilities.*
